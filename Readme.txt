Hello,

This is my project "my Library" based on React.

Here I have created an App, where you can browse through your book collection.

to Login to the app, you need to enter thr credentials added by me( they are mentioned at the top)

The main features of my app are - 


1. Browse by category  - you can just browse the books by category, by clicking on the category on the Navbar.

2. Delete Book button - here you can delete the book from your collection as soon as you click on the botton.

3, Add book option  - you can add the book of your choice by clicking on the "Add Book" button and by entering the details in the form.
